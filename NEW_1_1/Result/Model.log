                      than the lowest relevant system frequency (monitor at 0.3 GHz).
                      Please check the Settings for PML Boundary (Simulation > Settings > Boundary
                      Conditions > Open Boundary) to ensure accurate monitor results for the lowest
                      frequency of interest. More...
